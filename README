This Computer Vision project uses convolutional neural networks to predict
dog breeds.

A home-trained model and two Transfer Learning models are compared.

I'm using the Stanford Dogs Dataset:

The "V30" notebook showcases my best-performing home-trained model. Focusing on
10 dog breeds, it reaches a 0.46 test accuracy rate. It was fully trained on
Colab.

The "V57" notebook compares an older and a newer pretrained models, both used
with Transfer Learning: ResNet-50 and ConvNeXt Base. The additional training
is still done on Colab. This time we predict all 120 dog breeds. ResNet-50
reaches 0.50 test accuracy rate, while ConvNeXt Base achieves 0.90.
